# FXImageViewer
Demo written in JavaFX to view images in 3D space


This simple demo uses FXML to create components, although it was not necessary, given the simplicity of the layout.

Some random images are taken and published within ImageView.

They are also created from XYZ transformations for each image and for the current scene camera.

Everything is animated.

Enjoy
